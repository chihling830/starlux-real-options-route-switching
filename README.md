# STARLUX Airlines North America Route Conversion Option  
### A Real Options Analysis Project

## Overview
This project applies **real options analysis** to evaluate STARLUX Airlines’ strategic flexibility in reallocating aircraft capacity between North American routes.  
Specifically, we analyze the **option to convert flight capacity from Los Angeles (LAX) to Vancouver (YVR)** under uncertain demand, cost dynamics, and macroeconomic conditions.

The study demonstrates how managerial flexibility can create additional value beyond traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis.

---

## Motivation
- North America is a core long-term market for STARLUX Airlines.
- The Los Angeles route faces increasing competitive pressure, security concerns, and policy uncertainty.
- Vancouver shows stable demand driven by:
  - Strong Taiwanese and Chinese communities
  - Student and immigration flows
  - Tourism demand and sustainable airport infrastructure
- Real options theory provides a framework to **quantify the value of operational flexibility** under uncertainty.

---

## Project Structure
This project consists of:
- Market demand analysis (LAX vs. YVR)
- Cost structure modeling
- Revenue forecasting
- Scenario-based cash flow projections
- Real options valuation using NPV and expanded NPV (NPV*)

---

## Route Market Analysis
### Los Angeles (LAX)
- Highly competitive hub with intense price pressure
- Security and social concerns affecting traveler sentiment
- U.S. immigration policy uncertainty reducing specific travel demand

### Vancouver (YVR)
- High and stable load factors (>90% historically)
- Strong ethnic, student, and tourism-driven demand
- Long-term growth potential with lower volatility

---

## Cost Modeling
### Fixed Costs
- Aircraft acquisition costs (A350-900 and A350-1000)
- Straight-line depreciation over 20 years
- Airport-related charges (JFK, Taoyuan, destination airports)

### Variable Costs
- Fuel costs (modeled with historical growth rate of ~3.735%)
- Labor costs:
  - Taiwan-based crew growth: ~3.67%
  - North America-based crew growth: ~5%
- Maintenance and repair costs (modeled with ~4.73% annual growth)

---

## Revenue Model
Passenger revenue is estimated using:
Load factors and ticket prices vary across scenarios and routes.

---

## Scenario Design
Three demand scenarios are considered:
- **Optimistic**
- **Base (Ordinary)**
- **Pessimistic (Sorrow)**

Two strategic settings:
1. **With route conversion option (LAX → YVR)**
2. **Without route conversion (fixed allocation)**

---

## Valuation Methodology
- Discount rate computed using **WACC**
- Cash flows discounted to 2023
- Comparison between:
  - Traditional NPV
  - Expanded NPV (NPV*) incorporating managerial flexibility

---

## Key Results
| Scenario | NPV (No Flexibility) | NPV* (With Flexibility) | Option Value |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Optimistic | Positive | Higher | Significant |
| Base Case | Moderate | Higher | Positive |
| Pessimistic | Negative | Less Negative | High downside protection |

**Key insight:**  
The route conversion option substantially **reduces downside risk** and **increases expected project value**, especially under adverse market conditions.

---

## Managerial Implications
- Flexibility in route allocation has material economic value.
- Real options analysis provides better strategic guidance than static NPV.
- The conversion option acts as a natural hedge against demand shocks.
- Supports data-driven fleet and route planning decisions.

---

## Tools & Methods
- Financial modeling (Excel-based projections)
- Scenario analysis
- Discounted cash flow (DCF)
- Real options valuation framework

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how real options theory can be applied to airline route planning to quantify the value of strategic flexibility.  
In volatile and competitive aviation markets, incorporating flexibility into investment decisions is crucial for sustainable long-term performance.
